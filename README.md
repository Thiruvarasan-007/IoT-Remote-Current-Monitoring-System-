# IoT-Remote-Current-Monitoring-System-
A low-cost IoT current monitoring system using an ESP32 and a 4G LTE cellular module (SIM7600 / SIM800L) that sends current consumption data to a cloud. The system uses a current transformer (CT) processes RMS current on the ESP32, and transmits readings to the cloud through HTTP or MQTT using a SIM card.
